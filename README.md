# SoccerScoreKeeper_AppVersion

This is going to be the app version of the Soccer Score Keeper. The console was just the demo version I made. This will eventually be the final application.

The Idea is that this can have more than one team allowing for a bracket system.
The console version I made would only allow for 2 teams.
Now this one will have a bit more features than the console version.
The console version was just for the basic functionality which is pretty much done.
